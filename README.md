**Description:**  
The purpose of this project is to learn more about basic front-end development with upcoming populair libraries. This consists out of a static HTML page with some basic CSS and javascript using [HUGO](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo "Hugo Page") and [Grav](https://github.com/getgrav/grav, "Grav page") technologies. Instead of using basic CSS styling dependencies like Material.io or Bootstrap, I made use of [TailwindCSS](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss, "TailwindCSS page"). 

Grav is a content management system (CMS) that will help to manage the blogs that are being published on this website. The Grav admin plugin provides a simple and intuitive interface to make configuration and content creation easy and enjoyable. By using Hugo, we can easily generate a static HTML page with already some basic configuration. This will save precious configuration time, so that we can focus more on development. Also, the innovative library makes desinging web pages easier than ever.
